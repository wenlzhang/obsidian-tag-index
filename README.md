## Features

Tag Index solves the problem of tag overload by giving you a dedicated space for your most important tags:

### Core Features

- **Curated Tag Collection**: Create a personalized list of your most important tags separate from Obsidian's default tag pane
- **Hierarchical Tag Support**: Full support for nested tags with automatic tree structure (e.g., `#project/dev/feature`)
- **Multiple Addition Methods**: Add tags from the editor context menu, default tag pane, or command palette
- **Visual Organization**: Rearrange tags via intuitive drag and drop
- **Quick Note Access**: Click any tag to instantly see all notes using that tag

### Line Content Display

- **See Where Tags Appear**: View the actual line content where each tag exists in your notes
- **Clickable Navigation**: Click any line content to jump directly to that location in your note

### Interactive Navigation

- **Jump to Line**: Click line content to open the file at the exact line
- **Jump and Search**: Optionally open the search pane to see all tag occurrences across your vault
- **Configurable Cursor**: Choose whether the cursor lands at the start or end of the line
- **Hover Preview**: Hover over note names to preview their content without opening them

### Performance & Customization

- **Configurable Refresh Delay**: Set refresh delays from instant to 60 minutes based on vault size
- **Customizable Behavior**: Choose whether new tags are added to the top or bottom of your list

## Why Tag Index?

The default Obsidian tag pane can quickly become overwhelming for several reasons:

1. **Tag Overload**: As your vault grows, so does your tag list, creating visual chaos and making it difficult to find important tags
2. **External Syncing**: When syncing notes from external tools, unnecessary tags can clutter your tag pane
3. **No Prioritization**: The default tag pane treats all tags equally, with no way to highlight your most important ones
4. **Limited Entry Points**: Methods like the Zettelkasten (slip-box) require clear entry points to your knowledge system, which a cluttered tag pane can't provide
5. **Inefficient Navigation**: While you can click tags in the default pane to search for them, this workflow isn't optimized for frequent access

Tag Index solves these problems by giving you a dedicated space for the tags that matter most to you, with improved organization and navigation features.

## Getting Started

You can add tags to your index in multiple ways:

1. **From the Editor**: Right-click on any tag in your notes ‚Üí "Add to tag index"
2. **From Tag Pane**: Right-click on any tag in Obsidian's default tag pane ‚Üí "Add to tag index"
3. **Via Command**: Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P) ‚Üí "Tag Index: Add to tag index"

### Using Line Content Display

The plugin can show you exactly where tags appear in your files:

1. Enable **"Show line content"** in settings
2. Click on any tag to expand it
3. See all files containing that tag
4. View the actual lines where the tag appears
5. Click any line to jump directly to that location

### Configuring Behavior
