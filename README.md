An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that creates a curated list of important tags to serve as meaningful entry points to your knowledge base.

## Features

Tag Index solves the problem of tag overload by giving you a dedicated space for your most important tags:

- **Curated Tag Collection**: Create a personalized list of your most important tags separate from Obsidian's default tag pane
- **Multiple Addition Methods**: Add tags from the editor, default tag pane, or more in the future
- **Visual Organization**: Rearrange tags via intuitive drag and drop
- **Quick Note Access**: Click any tag to instantly see all notes using that tag
- **Content Preview**: Hover over note names to preview their content without opening them
- **Customizable Behavior**: Choose whether new tags are added to the top or bottom of your list

## Why Tag Index?

The default Obsidian tag pane can quickly become overwhelming for several reasons:

1. **Tag Overload**: As your vault grows, so does your tag list, creating visual chaos and making it difficult to find important tags
2. **External Syncing**: When syncing notes from external tools, unnecessary tags can clutter your tag pane
3. **No Prioritization**: The default tag pane treats all tags equally, with no way to highlight your most important ones
4. **Limited Entry Points**: Methods like the Zettelkasten (slip-box) require clear entry points to your knowledge system, which a cluttered tag pane can't provide
5. **Inefficient Navigation**: While you can click tags in the default pane to search for them, this workflow isn't optimized for frequent access

Tag Index solves these problems by giving you a dedicated space for the tags that matter most to you, with improved organization and navigation features.
